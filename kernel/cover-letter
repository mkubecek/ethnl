ethtool netlink interface, part 3

Implementation of more netlink request types:

  - netdev features (ethtool -k/-K, patches 3-6)
  - private flags (--show-priv-flags / --set-priv-flags, patches 7-9)
  - ring sizes (ethtool -g/-G, patches 10-12)
  - channel counts (ethtool -l/-L, patches 13-15)

Patch 1 is a style cleanup suggested in part 2 review and patch 2 updates
the mapping between netdev features and legacy ioctl requests (which are
still used by ethtool for backward compatibility).

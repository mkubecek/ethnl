ethtool netlink interface, part 4

Implementation of more netlink request types:

  - coalescing (ethtool -c/-C, patches 2-4)
  - pause parameters (ethtool -a/-A, patches 5-7)
  - EEE settings (--show-eee / --set-eee, patches 8-10)
  - timestamping info (-T, patches 11-12)

Patch 1 is a fix for netdev reference leak similar to commit 2f599ec422ad
("ethtool: fix reference leak in some *_SET handlers") but fixing a code
which is only in net-next tree at the moment.

Changes in v3
  - change "one-step-*" Tx type names to "onestep-*", (patch 11, suggested
    by Richard Cochran
  - use "TSINFO" rather than "TIMESTAMP" for timestamping information
    constants and adjust symbol names (patch 12, suggested by Richard
    Cochran)

Changes in v2:
  - fix compiler warning in net_hwtstamp_validate() (patch 11)
  - fix follow-up lines alignment (whitespace only, patches 3 and 8)

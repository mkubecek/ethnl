initial netlink interface implementation for 5.6 release

This series adds initial support for ethtool netlink interface provided by
kernel since 5.6-rc1. The traditional ioctl interface is still supported
for compatibility with older kernels. The netlink interface and message
formats are documented in Documentation/networking/ethtool-netlink.rst file
in kernel source tree.

Netlink interface is preferred but ethtool falls back to ioctl if netlink
interface is not available (i.e. the "ethtool" genetlink family is not
registered). It also falls back if a particular command is not implemented
in netlink (kernel returns -EOPNOTSUPP). This allows new ethtool versions
to work with older kernel versions while support for ethool commands is
added in steps.

The series aims to touch existing ioctl code as little as possible in the
first phase to minimize the risk of introducing regressions. It is also
possible to build ethtool without netlink support if --disable-netlink is
passed to configure script. The most visible changes to existing code are

  - UAPI header copies are moved to uapi/ under original names
  - some variables and functions which are going to be shared with netlink
    code are moved from ethtool.c to common.c and common.h
  - args[] array in ethtool.c was rewritten to use named initializers

Except for changes to main(), all netlink specific code is in a separate
directory netlink/ and is divided into multiple files.

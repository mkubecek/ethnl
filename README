This repository tracks the work on netlink interface for communication
between ethtool (and possibly other userspace tools) and kernel. The
ultimate goal is to provide a more flexible and extensible alternative to
the ioctl() interface used so far.

The work started as a SUSE Hackweek 16 project

  https://hackweek.suse.com/16/projects/netlink-interface-for-ethtool

but it's an ongoing effort aiming to get the interface into mainline kernel
and let ethtool use it where available.

There are two directories: kernel with a patch series for kernel (based on
net-next tree) and ethtool with a patch series for userspace ethtool
utility (based on master branch).

The patch sets are based on commits

  - kernel:    6c9ee3069380
  - ethtool:   7dc0af7e386e

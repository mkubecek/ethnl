This repository tracks the work on netlink interface for communication
between ethtool (and possibly other userspace tools) and kernel. The
ultimate goal is to provide a more flexible and extensible alternative to
the ioctl() interface used so far.

The work started as a SUSE Hackweek 16 project

  https://hackweek.suse.com/16/projects/netlink-interface-for-ethtool

but we were able to do much less than we wanted to. We do not want to give
up, though, so the work is going on.

Note that this hasn't been submitted yet, not even as an RFC so that
everything must be expected to change (and even more so once the work is
sent to upstream mailing list for review). Comments and suggestions are
welcome.
